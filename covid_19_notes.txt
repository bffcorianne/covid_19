The purpose of this project is that I wanted to see a graph that had both new deaths and new cases. Many of the sources show them in tandem.  

Examples:  

John's Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center dashboard.  

[https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/testing/tracker/overview] 

There's a weekly cyclical trend new stats (cases, deaths, tests).   



Are the peaks and dips on the same days?  




Jfc I cannot believe this is real life right now. How is this real.
